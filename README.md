## Overview
The goal for this project is to create a database that contains the data from my groceries receipts and to visualize the queries of that data.

### The data
I have collected my groceries receipts over the years and would like to store the information into a database.

Initially, there is no database only paper receipts.

The plan is:
- to convert the informations into either JSON or CSV files.
- create a SQL database
- import files into database
- make some UI for queries

I have little to no experience with UIs and wish to gain some experience working with database APIs.

### Motivation
Gain experience with databases and possibly web UIs.

Observe the data that I've collected.
