Each receipt has a store location, a date, and itemized priced list

each item in the list has an abbrev name and price; some items may include a sales price reduction

each receipt has a sales total

IF the item is on sale THEN there is a SALE SAVINGS value under the item; the items price on the receipt
	automatically includes the sale price reduction
	FOR EXAMPLE
		Red beans $0.69
		SALE $0.20

	Means the 'Normal price' is $0.89

So we must decide, when entering the data do we store normal price then calculate actual cost
 OR do we store actual cost and calculate normal price

Argument for the former; I think, generally, when querying the data for a large time period
	we are interested in the variabilty of the normal price
		That is to say: I anticipate the more frequent queries to be related to normal price
		so we can reduce compute by storing this price instead of calculating.

A query interested in the acutal price would be something like: "how much money did I spend on beans last year?"
A query interested in the normal price would be something like: "how has the cost/price of beans changed over the last year?"
